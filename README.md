## Hi there, I'm Praneetha Puchalapalli

Currently, I am working as a Software Engineer(Frontend) in Toshiba Software India Private Limited. Alongside, I am learning Data Science and Machine learning concepts and solved few business case studies. I love doing in-depth data analysis to figure out the hidden patterns in the data using various Mathematical tools and Python libraries. I am very curious to learn how mathematics solve machine learning problems. Still learning is in progress!

 **Experience**

I have been working in IT field Since August 2022. As a Frontend Engineer, I have good hands-on experience working with JavaScript, and React framework. 
My daily tasks include analyzing requirements, performing feasibility study, designing UI pages, developing code, writing unit test cases and deploying it. Hence, I have good exposure on end-to-end process.

**I am open to**
- Data Analyst roles where I can put forward my learning experience.
- Machine learning projects
- Research oriented projects
